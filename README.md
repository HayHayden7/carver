Carver is a VERY WIP port of Chisel to 1.16.

All blocks are made through the stonecutter. 

Requires CTM for certain blocks to function properly. Can be used standalone just fine, however.

I have done this without permission. If anyone from the chisel team wants me to take this project down, I will be happy to. JUST MAKE A 1.16 PORT ALREADY! Thanks.


Most textures have been created by Drullkus, the original artist of the Chisel mod. They are licensed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. This license allows me to share and adapt these textures as long as I give credit and use it non-commercially. Chisel itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License, which allows me to modify and share the mod(if I am understanding it correctly). I will share this same license with Chisel. I am not using any code from Chisel, but I am cut and pasting from certain mcmeta files and using textures. Since the license of the textures prohibits me from using them for financial gain, this project will not be monetized in any way, shape, or form.

If you would like to use this in a modpack or project, feel free. Just credit me if you want to.

Created with McCreator since I am too lazy to learn Java.
