This mod is a small mod that adds new variants of lanterns and pumpkins, for now. 

All blocks are made through the stonecutter.

Carver is a former port of Chisel. We have removed the ported textures and deleted the previous versions of the mod containing them so we can use our own license. 

If you would like to use this in a modpack or project, feel free. Just credit us if you want.

Created with McCreator since we are too lazy to learn Java.
